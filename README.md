Citizen AI is a web-based AI assistant that analyzes city safety and answers public serviceâ€“related questions.
It uses the IBM Granite 3.2 2B Instruct language model to generate informative responses.
Users can input any city name to receive insights on crime index, accident rates, and overall safety.
The application also handles queries related to government services, civic policies, and local issues.
It is built using Gradio, offering an interactive and user-friendly interface with separate tabs for each function.
The model runs efficiently on both CPU and GPU, making it accessible on most systems.
Prompt engineering ensures responses are relevant and focused on public interest.
The app is ideal for citizens, students, researchers, and civic planners.
It helps users make informed decisions about city safety and government services.
Citizen AI combines natural language processing and civic utility in a single platform.
